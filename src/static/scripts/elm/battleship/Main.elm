module Battleship where

-- NOTE

-- TODO
-- Add PlayerTurn Type? Benefit is the ability to move player specific stuff to its own functions
-- How to check for change in state? Do we check at the end of each action or do we check at the beginning of each action??? Is there a better way?
-- what is the right way to find a ship by id? is what the todo mvc does best practice? a filter on id?Options
    -- speaking of id. i rem in the tutorial there was some talk about optimizations b/c of id. must be called id?
-- should probably have two different boards... this way a player does not have to have the opponents board to generate their track......... damn!
-- checking for hits should use getCoordinates instead of iterating over the entire matrix. similar to `canAddShip`

-----------------------------------
-- Premature fucking optmization --
-----------------------------------
-- We could store the state of the board separate from the ships. We really
-- only need the ships to draw.
