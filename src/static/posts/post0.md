## Hi.

So yeah. This is my blog, and this is my 1st post. Future blog posts will take one of two forms.

1. Posts about blog implementation
2. Posts not about blog implemenation

With that being said, all the codes running the site are open source, so if you're interested, here you [go](https://github.com/john-kelly/john-kelly-org).

Additionally, for those who are interested, I have set two rules for myself related to how the blog will to be implemented.
1. No 3rd Party Packages (except for build)
2. Must write blog post for new features
