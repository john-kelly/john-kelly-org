## Hi.

So yeah. This is my blog, and this is my 1st post. Future blog posts will take one of two forms.

1. Posts about blog implementation
2. Posts not about blog implementation

With that being said, all the codes running the site are open source, so if you're interested, here you [go](https://github.com/john-kelly/john-kelly-org).
