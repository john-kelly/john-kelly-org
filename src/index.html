        <!-- The <header> element, like it sounds, is used to identify the top
        of a page, article, section, or other segment of a page. In general,
        the <header> element may include a heading, introductory text, and even
        navigation. -->
        <header>
            <!-- The <nav> element identifies a section of major navigational links
            on a page. The <nav> element should be reserved for primary navigation
            sections only, such as global navigation, a table of contents, previous
            /next links, or other noteworthy groups of navigational links. -->

        <!-- The <aside> element holds content, such as sidebars, inserts, or
        brief explanations, that is tangentially related to the content
        surrounding it. When used within an <article> element, for example, the
        <aside> element may identify content related to the author of the
        article. We may instinctively think of an <aside> element as an element
        that appears off to the left or right side of a page. We have to
        remember, though, that all of the structural elements, including the
        <aside> element, are block-level elements and as such will appear on a
        new line, occupying the full available width of the page or of the
        element they are nested within, also known as their parent element. -->
        <aside></aside>

        <!-- The <section> element is used to identify a thematic grouping of
        content, which generally, but not always, includes a heading. The
        grouping of content within the <section> element may be generic in
        nature, but it’s useful to identify all of the content as related. -->
        <section></section>

        <!-- The <article> element is used to identify a section of
        independent, self-contained content that may be independently
        distributed or reused. We’ll often use the <article> element to mark up
        blog posts, newspaper articles, user-submitted content, and the like.
        When deciding whether to use the <article> element, we must determine
        if the content within the element could be replicated elsewhere without
        any confusion. -->
        <article></article>

        <!-- The <footer> element identifies the closing or end of a page,
        article, section, or other segment of a page. Generally the <footer>
        element is found at the bottom of its parent. Content within the
        <footer> element should be relative information and should not diverge
        from the document or section it is included within. -->
