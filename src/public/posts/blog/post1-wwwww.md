## What is Node.js?
At a high level, Node.js gives programmers an environment to use JavaScript outside of a web browser. At a low level, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment comprised of 3 parts:

1. Google's V8 JavaScript Engine
2. An event loop
3. A low-level I/O API

#### TL;DR;
Node.js makes JavaScript relevant outside of the web browser.

## Why Node.js?
There are a number of technical pros and cons when considering Node.js for a production setting; I am not going to focus on them. I (like many web developers) am more interested in the fact that Node.js makes it possible to code my web application in a single language; both server and client written JavaScript. Beautiful.

#### TL;DR;
Node.js makes JavaScript the language of both the client and the server.
